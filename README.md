## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Food Image Recognition** — Snap a photo of your meal and get instant calorie estimates using a trained EfficientNet-B4 model
- 🔍 **Barcode Scanner** — Scan packaged food barcodes for accurate nutrition labels
- 🥗 **Nutrition Breakdown** — View calories, protein, carbs, fats and more
- 📊 **Nutrition Database** — Backed by USDA FoodData Central dataset
- 📱 **Mobile Ready** — Built with React + Capacitor for Android deployment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.9+
- Android Studio (for APK build)

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Android APK

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```
Then in Android Studio: **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**

### Python / Backend Setup

```bash

## 🧠 ML Model

- Architecture: **EfficientNet-B4**
- Trained on a custom merged food image dataset
- Used for real-time food classification from camera input

---

## 📦 Dataset

The app uses the **USDA FoodData Central** foundation foods dataset for nutritional data.  
Dataset not included in this repo due to size — download from [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html).
